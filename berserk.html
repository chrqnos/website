        <h1> Berserk</h1>
        <p>Guts, known as the Black Swordsman,<br> seeks sanctuary from the demonic forces attracted to him and<br> his woman because of a demonic mark on their necks, and also vengeance <br>against the man who branded him as an unholy sacrifice. Aided only by his <br>titanic strength gained from a harsh childhood lived <br>with mercenaries, a gigantic sword, and an iron prosthetic <br>left hand, Gats must struggle against his bleak destiny, all the while fighting with<br> a rage that might strip him of his humanity.</p>
        <p><br>Personal Opinion: <br> The starting of this story was quite rough as the art was not the best and was <br>quite different to the rest of manga that I usually read. <br>The story itself was full of gore and definitely not something you'd <br>show to kids but I believe it is one of the best <br>pieces of fiction ever written and I thoroughly <br>enjoyed seeing the character development of the character Guts,<br> from a person who cares about no <br>one to someone who open up. </p>
