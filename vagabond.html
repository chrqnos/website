        <h1> Vagabond</h1>
        <p>Striving for enlightenment by way of the sword,<br> Miyamoto Musashi is prepared to cut down anyone who stands in his way. <br>Vagabond is an action-packed portrayal of the life and times <br>of the quintessential warrior-philosopher-one of <br>the most celebrated samurai of all time!Vagabond portrays a<br> fictionalized account of Miyamoto Musashi's life, <br>on a loose adaptation of Eiji Yoshikawa's novel "Musashi".</p>
        <p><br>Personal Opinion:<br>This manga was quite beatiful. <br>It was based off of an actual historical figure <br>with the same name, and he's known as<br> the man who's won the most duels. Miyamoto Musashi <br>also has written two books shortly before his <br>death, and I have read one of them. Both the <br>manga based off of him and his actual book have <br>been amazing reads. Just like Guts, we see <br>Musashi become someones who cares for others as<br> the manga progresses.</p>
