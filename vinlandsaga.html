        <h1> Vinland Saga</h1>
        <p>Thorfinn is son to one of the Viking's greatest warriors,<br> but when his father is killed in battle by the mercenary leader Askeladd, <br>he swears his intent to have revenge. Thorfinn joins Askeladd's<br> group in order to challenge him to a duel, and ends up caught in the <br>middle of a war for the crown of England.</p>
        <p><br>Personal Opinion:<br>This story and main character is personally my favourite.<br>Just like Miyamoto Musashi, the main character of this manga, <br>Thorfinn, is also based off of a real historical figure. <br>Thorfinn's father is a very respectful man <br>and has taught Thorfinn to be just like him,<br> however after his death, Thorfinn becomes a <br>horrible person while fighting as a mercenary under his father's <br>killer. This story is really amazing seeing Thorfinn's devlopement. <br>The background of this site itself is an amazing panel.</p>
